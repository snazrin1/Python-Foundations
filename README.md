# Python-Foundations

This is my professional coding journal for the 2026 After-School Coding Program.

# Lesson 1: Hello World
- Created a GitHub account.
- Launched a cloud-based development environment using **GitHub Codespaces**.
- Wrote and executed my first Python script: `myfirstcodehello.py`.

#Tools Used
* Python 3
* VS Code (via Codespaces)
* Git for Version Control

# Lesson 2 : Variables, Input, F-String
- Learned how to use input() and variables
- Created Story Generator mini project

# Lesson 3 : Numbers and Operations
- Learned int, float, operators
- Created simple calculator mini project

# Project 1 : ASCII Art
**Skill Learned:** Multi-line strings and terminal formatting.
**Challenge:** Creating a visual "Welcome" sign for my repository.

# Project 2 : Furniture Store

### **Project Overview**
Developed a terminal-based Point of Sale (POS) system for a boutique furniture store. The script manages an inventory catalog and processes customer transactions.

### **Core Skills**
* **State Management:** Tracking a running subtotal and item list.
* **Assignment Operators:** Using `+=` to update numeric and string data.
* **Business Math:** Applying an 8.8% sales tax to a finalized subtotal.
* **Professional Formatting:** Using **f-strings** for two-decimal currency precision.

### **Execution Logic**
1. **Catalog:** Stored product descriptions and prices in variables.
2. **Transactions:** Updated the total and itemization string as items were "purchased".
3. **Checkout:** Calculated and added tax to the final bill.
4. **Reporting:** Generated a clean, formatted receipt for the user.
